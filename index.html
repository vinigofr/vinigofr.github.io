        <p class="section__paragraph">Recentely, I decided to delete my old portfolio because I wasn't happy with it. It
          wasn't representing me anymore at my carrer stage, so I decided to delete it. But don't worry! I'll start a
          new one
          from scratch, so you wont find nothing interesting here for now.</p>
